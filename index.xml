Overview#SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, and it refers to a protocol for encrypting, securing, and authenticating communications that take place on the Internet. Although SSL was replaced by an updated protocol called TLS (Transport Layer Security) some time ago, &amp;ldquo;SSL&amp;rdquo; is still a commonly used term for this technology

      <description>Communication#Request-Response#Overview#The Request-Response pattern is a fundamental communication pattern where a client sends a request to a server, and the server processes the request and sends back a response. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most common patterns for communication in distributed systems, client-server architectures, and web applications.

      <description>Chrome Architecture#Prerequisites#Read process vs thread first if you don&amp;rsquo;t have any process and thread concept in your mind
Browser Architecture#When you start an application, a process is created. The program might create thread(s) to help it do work, but that&amp;rsquo;s optional. The Operating System gives the process a &amp;ldquo;slab&amp;rdquo; of memory to work with and all application state is kept in that private memory space.</description>

A hash table is a data structure that you can use to store data in key-value format with direct access to its items in constant time
The most valuable aspect of a hash table over other abstract data structures is its speed to perform insertion, deletion, and search operations. Hash tables can do them all in constant time</description>
