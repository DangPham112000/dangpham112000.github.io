<p>When you start an application, a process is created. The program might create thread(s) to help it do work, but that&rsquo;s optional. The Operating System gives the process a &ldquo;slab&rdquo; of memory to work with and all application state is kept in that private memory space. When you close the application, the process also goes away and the Operating System frees up the memory</p>
<p>A process can ask the Operating System to spin up another process to run different tasks. When this happens, different parts of the memory are allocated for the new process. If two processes need to talk, they can do so by using <strong>I</strong>nter <strong>P</strong>rocess <strong>C</strong>ommunication (<strong>IPC</strong>). Many applications are designed to work this way so that if a worker process get unresponsive, it can be restarted without stopping other processes which are running different parts of the application</p>

<p>A website usually uses external resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript. Those files need to be loaded from network or cache. The main thread could request them one by one as they find them while parsing to build a DOM, but in order to speed up, &ldquo;preload scanner&rdquo; is run concurrently.</p>
<p>When the HTML parser finds a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, <strong>it pauses the parsing of the HTML document</strong> and has to load, parse, and execute the JavaScript code<br>
Why? Because JavaScript can change the shape of the document using things like <code>document.write()</code> which changes the entire DOM structure</p>
<p><img src="/research/chrome_architecture/script_load.png" alt="script_load" /></p>
<p>The browser then loads and runs the JavaScript code asynchronously and does not block the parsing. You may also use JavaScript module if that&rsquo;s suitable. <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&gt;</code> is a way to inform browser that the resource is definitely needed for current navigation and you would like to download as soon as possible. You can read more on this at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization">Resource Prioritization</a></p>
<h3 id="javascript">

<p>JavaScript, as you may already know, is single threaded, hence you can’t spawn new threads as you like to spread your computation cost over multiple CPU’s core for <strong>true-parallel</strong> work</p>
<p><img src="/research/chrome_architecture/javascript.png" alt="javascript" /></p>
<p>When your code is executed it may call the Browser’s APIs to interact with the DOM or schedule some async task. Those async tasks are added to the <strong>Event queue</strong> or to the prioritized <strong>Job queue</strong> (if using Promises). As soon as the the Call Stack has finished to process the current tick (is empty), the Event Loop feeds it with a new Tick (which is composed by ONE callback, the FULL job queue, and the POSSIBILITY to call, fully or only some parts, the <strong>Render queue</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call Stack</strong>: it is the place where <strong>your code is executed</strong> (your functions are loaded and executed, V8 engine in Chrome and NodeJS), it is basically a LIFO stack (last-in-first-out), when it is empty, a.k.a. has completed all the current Tick tasks, it becomes ready to accept the next Tick from the Event Loop</li>
<li><strong>Browser APIs: a link between your code and the browser’s internals</strong> to schedule tasks, interact with the DOM and more (ex. setTimeout, AJAX, createElement, querySelector, append, click, etc.). In case of callbacks they will add your callback code to the <strong>Event queue</strong>, instead, in case of a then (promise’s method), your then-code will be added to the <strong>Job Queue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Event queue</strong>: every time you add a callback (ex. via the setTimeout or the AJAX APIs), it is added to this queue</li>
<li><strong>Job queue</strong>: this queue is reserved for promise’s thens, it is a prioritized queue, its meaning is like <strong>‘execute this code later (= asynchronously), but as soon as possible! (= before the next Event Loop tick)’</strong>, and this is why browsers had introduced this new queue to fulfil the Promises specifications</li>
<li><strong>Render queue</strong>: this is explained in <a href="https://frarizzi.science/journal/web-engineering/browser-rendering-queue-in-depth">another article</a></li>
<li><strong>Next Tick</strong>: it is what will be executed next, basically it’s composed by <strong>ONE callback</strong> from the Event queue, <strong>THE FULL Job queue</strong> (this point is important, <strong>the current tick will finish only after the Job queue is empty</strong>, so you may inadvertently block it from going to the next Tick if you continuously add new jobs to this queue), <strong>may re-render</strong> (execute the necessary steps in the Render queue to update the screen)</li>
<li><strong>Event Loop</strong>: it monitors the Call Stack, as soon as it is empty (has finished to process the current tick), the Event Loop feeds it with the next Tick</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the main thread there are many other threads spawned by the browser to do useful stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parser Thread</strong>: parses your code in <strong>machine-understandable</strong> trees</li>
<li><strong>Statistics collector Thread</strong>: collects data and statistics to discover insights about your code (the scope is to optimize it runtime)</li>
<li><strong>Optimizer Thread</strong>: uses the statistics and insights collected by the Statistics collector Thread to make performance optimizations over your code (Caching, Inlining, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Garbage Collector Thread</strong>: removes unconnected (<strong>no more referenceable from the ROOT node</strong>) JavaScript objects to free up memory using a mark-and-sweep algorithm. We don’t know when this will happen and have no control over it. AFAIK the browser uses this thread to track whose objects to remove and do useful stuff, but when it needs to remove them it actually blocks the main thread and uses it. From the Firefox blog Q:”Silly question here, why must garbage collection stop UI events and js execution? Couldn’t the GC just run in a separate thread?”, R:”It can be done, but the garbage collector is looking at the same objects that the JS currently running is touching, so it must be done carefully. That said, the Firefox GC actually does do some work on a separate thread: some types of objects can be thrown away once they are known to be garbage without affecting the main thread.”</li>
<li><strong>Rasterizer Thread</strong>: rasterize your graphic into frames</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>

<p>The browser process is only aware of where that gesture occurred since content inside of a tab is handled by the renderer process. So the browser process sends the event type (like <code>touchstart</code>) and its coordinates to the renderer process</p>
<p>Renderer process handles the event appropriately by finding the event target and running event listeners that are attached</p>

<p>If no input event listeners are attached to the page, Compositor thread can create a new composite frame completely independent of the main thread. But what if some event listeners were attached to the page? How would the compositor thread find out if the event needs to be handled?</p>

</h3>
<p>Since running JavaScript is the main thread&rsquo;s job, when a page is composited, the compositor thread marks a region of the page that has event handlers attached as &ldquo;Non-Fast Scrollable Region&rdquo;</p>
<p>By having this information, the compositor thread can make sure to send input event to the main thread if the event occurs in that region. If input event comes from outside of this region, then the compositor thread carries on compositing new frame without waiting for the main thread</p>
